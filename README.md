This is a tool for helping along 5E D&D campaigns. Characters, places and
objects are defined in simple JSON and the DM (Dungeon Master) can control
information and track combat events via the server console.

To run, edit JSON appropriately, compile the dmhelper.go and launch the
process. It will run on port 8080 and commands from stdin. There is no command
help of course, so just check the crazy code :)
